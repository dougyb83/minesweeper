# MINESWEEPER

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game that challenges players to uncover hidden mines on a grid by strategically revealing tiles. 

Our target audience includes both casual gamers looking for a quick mental challenge, puzzle enthusiasts and retro game lovers seeking a nostalgic experience. Whether you're a seasoned minesweeper veteran or a newcomer to the game, our project caters to all skill levels. With its responsive design, the game can be played on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones, making it accessible to players on the go.

The game not only provides entertainment but also serves as a mental exercise, promoting strategic thinking, problem-solving, and pattern recognition skills. Players can compete against themselves by aiming for faster completion times.

In summary, our web-based responsive minesweeper game is designed to appeal to a wide range of players, from casual and retro gamers to puzzle enthusiasts, offering an engaging and accessible experience.

## UX

As this websites purpose is to provide a gaming experience for the user I have decided to make the home page in the style of a gaming main menu. It will be simple and easy to understand with options provided for different game difficulty levels followed by an explaination of how to play the game.

Once the difficulty setting has been selected the appropriate game page will load. The game board will occupy most of the screen on mobile devices while still making navigation buttons and infomation displays available. This will give the user the best gameplay experience while still giving them full navigation.

On desktop and laptop there is more screen real-estate so the game board wwon't fill the screen in the same way but will be more central with space on all four sides. This will be more pleasing to the users eye and will provide a better gameplay experience by keeping the mouse movements within a smaller area.

### Colour Scheme

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Explain your colours and the colour scheme.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#E84610` used for primary highlights.
- `#4A4A4F` used for secondary text.
- `#009FE3` used for secondary highlights.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Consider adding a link and screenshot for your colour scheme using "coolors".
https://coolors.co/generate

When you add a colour to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your colour palette later if needed.

Example:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

If you've used CSS `:root` variables, consider also including a code snippet here!

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    /* P = Primary | S = Secondary */
    --p-text: #000000;
    --p-highlight: #E84610;
    --s-text: #4A4A4F;
    --s-highlight: #009FE3;
    --white: #FFFFFF;
    --black: #000000;
}
```

### Typography

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like Google Fonts and/or Font Awesome.

Consider adding a link to each font used, and the Font Awesome site if used (or similar icon library).

Example:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.
